      <p> "Imagine the pride a family
        experiences when their first born receives a scholarship to pay for a degree from
        Baruch College in New York. A promising future in Accounting and Business Management was interrupted when an
        offer was presented to manage a multi-million-dollar company handling precious metals and stones. At the young
        age of 19, being offered a salary twice as much as I would start off with as a college graduate, was appealing
        enough for me to pause my degree for some real-world education. Extremely lucrative and rewarding as it was,
        the
        benefits of travel and meeting influential people added to the overall romance with early success. Human
        nature
        leads most of us to seek instant gratification and the ride was exhilarating until some 20 years later when
        the
        company went bankrupt, and so was I. At the ripe age of 40, I was faced with harsh reality that the job market
        demands formal education in addition to experience. While I was able to find a different path to success, I
        had
        to overcome many challenges that with a degree, would have been much less."

      <p>“I joined the military to take advantage of the school and home buying programs that the military has to
        offer. Originally, I did it part-time, but the benefits increased with full-time involvement. The military
        has given me the opportunity to grow, leave my home, and travel the world. I recommend the job for those who
        want to leave their hometown and experience more than they would if they stayed in the same 50-mile radius
        they grew up in. You experience a wide spectrum of personalities and cultures in the military, which can be
        difficult occasionally, but a short-term contract with the military can provide perspective on the world and
        help you develop personally and financially."

      <article class="story">
        <p>“There were many reasons I decided to get my PhD. To develop the skills of how to design and test a
          hypothesis, to contribute to our wider scientific understanding (there are some things we still don't
          understand, in biology/disease specifically, and having even a small contribution there was important
          to me), and to further develop critical thinking. My PhD was extremely important for my career
          development. To deal with cutting edge technology, you need to be able to think critically and also
          understand what can be possible. That is, even to innovate, you have to anticipate. For that, you need
          the critical eye and understanding whether there is enough scientific knowledge to support the
          likelihood of the possibility. I recommend this program to those who feel the way I did and that are
          seeking careers in technology- in particular in developing technology. If lucky and paired with good
          mentors, you can make friends for life in the program. Chasing a hypothesis and doing research is very
          hard, but you meet people along the way who are there with you and they remain part of your life. I
          had a great experience. It is important to keep in mind that there are other ways to get involved in
          tech without a PhD. So because of the commitment it has to be a personal decision if you really want
          to learn how to be and think like a scientist.”

        <p>“I decided to go to law school because I was bored and I wanted to help pay for my kids to go to
          college. Once I started, I didn’t have time for a social life or to continue to play tennis, golf,
          or to paint. Also, I was 43 years old competing with classmates who were in their early 20s.
          Getting a J.D. is a tremendous amount of work, but I was determined to succeed. Besides learning
          about multiple areas of the law, I learned how to think and write like a lawyer, as well as how to
          do legal research. My legal lessons at law school prepared me for a demanding position as an
          associate at a Wall Street law firm. The JD degree coupled with an LL.M in tax law led me to a
          successful career in international tax and estate planning and a position as a Vice President in
          the Latin American Private Bank at JPMorgan Chase. Law School can prepare a person for a career in
          multiple areas of the law and other positions outside the law. I recommend law school to a person
          with high verbal & writing skills, an analytical mind, and a strong work ethic.”</p>

        <p>“Hello, my name is Anthony Lizardo and I am a NYC green roof installer. As a green roof
          installer, you are part of the bigger solution to combating climate change. You are a
          landscaper, an irrigation technician, and a roofer working on everything from garage roofs
          to high-rise buildings. You get to see the city from a perspective not many others will
          ever have, while helping the community and building beautiful systems and gardens. The
          field itself is growing, as cities begin to mandate more buildings to either have green
          roofs, solar panels, or a combination of both, and the government allocates more funds and
          tax incentives to make green roofs more commonplace. This is a career with room for upward
          growth, that promises stability and benefits the community. It's not for everyone though,
          as it is physically demanding labor-intensive work. You are outside all day in all weather
          conditions and have to be comfortable around both insects and heights. Ladders and
          harnesses are common tools that we use, and insects like centipedes or spiders can not be
          avoided either. You will be working mostly with high-end clients as most people still can't afford green
          roofs, though
          as the industry keeps growing that will continue to change as they become more accessible.
          The final con, the pay in this industry lags behind other trades. Starting pay ranges from
          $20-$25 hourly and for a job as technically involved and labor intensive as this, that is
          not great. As the industry grows that may also continue to change for the better, but as
          of right now, it is a major factor.”

      <article class="story">
        <p>“Hey, my name is Caleb and I’m a tattoo apprentice. Growing up I only had an interest
          in art, and that showed negatively in my grades throughout high school I wasn’t
          interested in college, so I knew I needed to start working fast. I spent a little over 2
          years working farming and landscaping jobs. But I knew I didn’t want to do this kind of
          work for long. It took a lot of courage to leave my secure job to seek out a tattoo
          apprenticeship. I was lucky enough to have a strong support system, so I wasn’t alone. I
          had the freedom to try and commit to something I’ve wanted since I was 12 years old. If I
          had to give you one piece of advice, life is unpredictable
          so never stop yourself from going after something you’re passionate about. All of the
          limitations set in your path, all of the doubt others give you, cast that aside, and
          don’t lose faith in yourself. I don’t recommend becoming a tattoo artist. Although I
          would never stop someone who was passionate from trying, I would inform them of all the
          risks involved. Tattooing is seasonal, you will go long stretches of time without having
          any revenue from walk-in clients. Oftentimes you will spend full work weeks in a shop
          and barely make anything near minimum wage. The profession is over-saturated (there are
          so many new artists getting into the industry, making it extremely difficult to stand
          out from the crowd unless you’re extremely proficient at a style). A tattooer will only
          get good enough at tattooing to do small quick things. Tattoo artists completely invest
          themselves in the industry and lifestyle.
