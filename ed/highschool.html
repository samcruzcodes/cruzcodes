    <!-- pomodoro method -->
    <h3>Highschool is the best time to learn how to learn. Without knowing how to learn you will never be able to study
      effectively. So we highly recommend you consider watching <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O96fE1E-rf8&ab_channel=TEDxTalks" class="inText" target="_blank">this
        video</a> before moving forward.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>Now that you know how to learn we present to you the <span class="pomo">pomodoro method</span>. You may be
      wondering, what is that? It's a simple and effective approach designed to improve focus, productivity, and
      efficiency during
      study or work sessions. The method involves breaking your work or study time into short intervals called
      "pomodoros," followed by short breaks. </h3>
    <center>
      <h3>Below we present you pomofocus.io, an online pomodoro timer!</h3>

    <h2>Volunteer Resources</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Having good grades is important, but it is equally important to be well-rounded. One of the best ways to do this
      in high school and beyond is volunteering. Not only will this be a great resume-builder, but you are taking part
      in a purpose greater than yourself. That being said, it’s not about how much time you can give, but about the love
      you pour from your heart into what you do.</h3>

      students the opportunity to apply academic skills in a real-world context, and are thus considered part of a
      well-rounded education. We are also adding in a link to an article by College Vine regarding more than 900 ideas
      that you can do for extracurricular activities.
