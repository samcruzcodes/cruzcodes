      <p class="desc">College can be an amazing and unforgettable time in your life. However it could also be really
        tough for some. College is different from high school in many ways. The classes, homework, readings, and even
        the people you meet will be different—but you can definitely succeed with the right mindset. We want to help you
        through this journey!

    <h2>Scholarships</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>It’s never too late to begin the search for college scholarships. Scholarships provide an opportunity for people
      to earn an education. Without assistance from an outside source, students may have trouble paying for the degree.
      Without the burden of Finance on students' minds lowered, scholarships help them have more time to focus on their
      studies.

    <h2>Volunteering</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Having good grades is important, but it is equally important to be well-rounded. One of the best ways to do this
      in College and beyond is volunteering. Not only will this be a great resume-builder, but you are taking part in a
      purpose greater than yourself. That being said, it’s not about how much time you can give, but about the love you
      pour from your heart into what you do.
